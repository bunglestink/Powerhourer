Powerhourer
===========

Overview
--------

This is a remake of a Powerhour application that I made in college.  I did this for two reasons:

1. Make something in Silverlight that accesses client data.
2. Remake the Powerhourer, as I have long lost the original version and source.

The powerhourer is a basic music mixer that is used to generate powerhour mixes.  A powerhour mix is a collection of songs that changes the song every minute.  Google "Powerhour" for more info on this one... :)

This version is poor on features, but has the basic functionality down, and is usable.  As of the time of writing, I haven't used it to do a powerhour, but if I do one again, I will be sure to use this.
